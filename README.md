# Webbpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

If you want to follow along, start from branch 0-initial-setup. Each branch in this project is a step along the path to creating a fully functional webpack setup. In each branch, there will be a documentation file that lists out the steps taken in that branch (each step is also roughly a git commit if you look at the history) which you can use as a checklist when setting up your own projects.
